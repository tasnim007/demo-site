# Welcome!


We are the *Natural Language Processing (NLP) Research Group* at the **_Nanyang Technological University_**. Our work covers all aspects of NLP research, ranging from core NLP tasks to key downstream applications, and new machine learning methods. More specifically, we study

  
* __Discourse Analysis__ including discourse parsing, coherence modeling, topic modeling, coreference resolution and conversational models. We focus on both monologue and conversations. 
* __Representation Learning__ of words and sentences in single language, multilingual, and multi-modal settings.
* __NLP Applications__ including question answering, machine translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, digital humanitarian, social science, and medical informatics.

A key theme emphasized throughout our research is to effectively combine deep linguistic analysis with innovative probabilistic machine learning models encompassing deep neural nets, graphical models and reinforcement learning. Our research has resulted in state-of-the-art technologies, which include a discourse parser, a coherence model, a dialogue act tagger for asynchronous conversations, a machine translation system, and a community question answering system. Our group includes members from the [Linguistics Department](http://www.soh.ntu.edu.sg/Programmes/linguistics/Pages/Home.aspx) and  the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](http://scse.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx). We also collaborate with external partners from academia and industry.
