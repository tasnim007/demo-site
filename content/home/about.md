# Welcome!


We are the Natural Language Processing Research Group of the School of Computer Science and Engineering at the Nanyang Technological University. Our work includes research projects as well as collaborations with industrial partners and the public sector. Our areas of expertise include linguistic resources, semantic networks and representations, machine translation, syntax and morphology. 

Our group studies a range of core NLP problems (such as parsing, information extraction, and machine translation) as well as emerging challenges (such as modeling and processing social media text, analyzing linguistic style, and jointly modeling language and vision). Our research is highly collaborative: we regularly work with researchers across the NTU campus including many other computer scientists, computational linguists, speech researchers, and social scientists. We also engage a wide range of industry partners like the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Microsoft Research, Google, Facebook, and Intel.
